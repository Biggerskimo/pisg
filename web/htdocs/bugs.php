<h3>Reporting bugs</h3>
If you find a bug in pisg, we would like to hear about it.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps to report the bug, and you'll make life easier for
us:
<ul>
<li>Make sure your bug exists in the latest pisg version</li>
<li>Go to the sourceforge <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=31862&amp;atid=403711">bug tracking system</a></li>
<li>Create a new bug if the problem isn't reported already</li>
<li>If you are having a specific problem with the output or the log
parsing - then you <b>must</b> attach a sample logfile which reproduces
the problem, if you are unsure whether it's needed in your bug report,
then <b>please add it anyway</b>.</li>
<li>Done...</li>
</ul>
