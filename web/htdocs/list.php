<b>Guidelines</b><br />
In order to save time and get the best out of all posts to the
mailing list, you are encouraged to follow these guidelines:<br />
<ul>
    <li>When you are having a problem with logparsing, then include a
    <b>sample logfile</b>, your <b>pisg.cfg</b> and possibly an example of
    the generated HTML output. You might need to compress the files with
    gzip/zip before sending to the list, or upload the files to a remote
    webserver which we can access.</li>
    <li>It's highly recommended that you type your replies *below* the text
    you are replying to. This is done by quoting the text with a &gt; in
    front of the replied lines, and inserting the reply below. Most e-mail
    clients insert the quote-characters automatically.</li>
</ul>
